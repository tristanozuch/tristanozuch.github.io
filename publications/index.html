<br /> Luca Venturi, Samy Jelassi, Tristan Ozuch, Joan Bruna. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2102.01621"> Depth separation beyond radial functions.</a> (45p.)  <i>preprint </i>. 2021
<br /> 
<details>
  <summary>More details:</summary><div style="margin: 15px;"> High-dimensional depth separation results for neural networks show that certain functions can be efficiently approximated by two-hidden-layer networks but not by one-hidden-layer ones in high-dimensions d. Existing results of this type mainly focus on functions with an underlying radial or one-dimensional structure, which are usually not encountered in practice. The first contribution of this paper is to extend such results to a more general class of functions, namely functions with piece-wise oscillatory structure, by building on the proof strategy of (Eldan and Shamir, 2016).  A common theme in the proof of such results is the fact that one-hidden-layer fail to approximate high-energy functions whose Fourier representation is spread in the domain. On the other hand, existing approximation results of a function by one-hidden-layer neural networks rely on the function having a sparse Fourier representation. The choice of the domain also represents a source of gaps between upper and lower approximation bounds. Focusing on a fixed approximation domain, namely the (d-1)-dimensional sphere, we provide a characterization of both functions which are efficiently approximable by one-hidden-layer networks and of functions which are provably not, in terms of their Fourier expansion. </div>

 2020<br /> 
<details>
  <summary>More details:</summary>
<div style="margin: 15px;"> I motivate the following question: If an Einstein orbifold is a Gromov-Hausdorff limit of Einstein metrics bubbling out Eguchi-Hanson metrics, then, is it necessarily Kähler? It is done by identifying new obstructions to the desingularization of Einstein metrics which are specific to the compact situation. I then test these new obstructions for desingularization of a flat orbifold and show how obstructed this procedure is.</div>

<br /> Alix Deruelle, T. Ozuch. <a href="https://https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.09937"> A Łojasiewicz inequality for ALE metrics.</a> (63p.)  <i>preprint </i>.
 2020
<br /> 
<details>
  <summary>More details:</summary><div style="margin: 15px;"> We introduce a functional, on ALE manifolds whose critical points are Ricci-flat and such that the Ricci flow is its gradient flow. The ADM-mass appears in its expression as a boundary term. We study its properties with respect to the Ricci flow and prove that it satisfies a weighted Łojasiewicz inequality. We moreover study the properties of the ADM-mass for ALE metrics with nonnegative scalar curvature near Ricci-flat metrics or on spin manifolds. </div>

<br /> <details>
  <summary>More details:</summary><div style="margin: 15px;"> I refine the Gromov-Hausdorff convergence theorem of noncollapsed Einstein 4-manifolds of Anderson and Bando-Kasue-Nakajima. I more precisely obtain a convergence in weighted Hölder spaces by constructing optimal coordinates in the neck regions.</div>

<br /> T. Ozuch. <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.12960"> Noncollapsed degeneration of Einstein 4-manifolds II.</a> (82p.) <i>preprint </i>.
 2019 
<br /> <details>
  <summary>More details:</summary><div style="margin: 15px;"> I develop an analysis in the weighted Hölder spaces of the first article of the series and produce any noncollapsed Gromov-Hausdorff degeneration of Einstein 4-manifolds as the result of a gluing-perturbation procedure adapted to multiple trees of singularities. This is then used to extend an obstruction found by Biquard to the conjecturally general situation.</div>

  <summary>More details:</summary>
  <div style="margin: 15px;"> I produce any noncollapsed Gromov-Hausdorff degeneration of Einstein 4-manifolds as the result of a gluing-perturbation procedure. This lets me extend an obstruction to the desingularization of Einstein orbifolds found by Biquard to the conjecturally general case. This also shows that the completion of moduli space of Einstein 4-manifolds is the zero set of a smooth function on a finite dimensional manifold. </div>

<div style="margin: 15px;"> I characterize cones, manifolds with conical singularities and asymptotic to cones with finite Perelman's functionals. After proving a global pseudolocality theorem, these controls on Perelman's functionals are used to produce type III Ricci flows smoothing out some cones.</div>
